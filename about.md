My name is Ted Keast, and I am an aspiring full stack web developer. I graduated from Emory University in 2011 and worked for several years at a financial data company before leaving in search of a more interesting opportunity. I wanted a career that combined my problem-solving skills with my passion for building and creating, and that's when I first began to explore web development. For the past six months I have been enrolled in Bloc coding bootcamp, an immersive online school which has helped me learn to build web applications. Through Bloc I gained experience working with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, HTML, and CSS, as well as various other useful gems and libraries. My hope is that I can attain a job in web development so that I can practice the skills I learned at Bloc and continue my coding education.
