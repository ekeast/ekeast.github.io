short-description: An interactive to-do list built with AngularJS and Firebase

---
Blocitoff an interactive to-do list where users can add, prioritize, and complete tasks. Blocitoff has two templates, one for displaying the current tasks and another for tasks that are either completed or have expired (meaning they are older than seven days and incomplete). The application was built using:

* AngularJS
* Firebase cloud storage
* HTML/CSS
* Moment.js library
* Animation.js library

The code can be viewed on my Github page at https://github.com/ekeast.
