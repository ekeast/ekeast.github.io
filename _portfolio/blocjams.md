short-description: A music-streaming application built with AngularJS

---
Bloc-Jams is a music service that allows users to stream, pause, play, or skip through songs in an album. Users can scan through songs and adjust the volume with tracking bars. The application was built using:

* AngularJS
* jQuery
* HTML/CSS
* Buzz.js library
* Angular UI-Router

The code can be viewed on my Github page at https://github.com/ekeast.
